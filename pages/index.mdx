# API Documentation

Welcome to the official API documentation for KSD. This documentation provides detailed information on how to use our APIs to integrate with our platform, access data, and perform various operations.

## Overview

Our API allows you to interact with different resources through simple HTTP requests. Whether you're building a web application, mobile app, or any service that needs to communicate with our system, this documentation will guide you through the process of using our APIs.

### Base URL

All API requests are made to the following base URL:
```
https://next-ksd.pekalongankab.go.id/api/v1

```

This URL should be prefixed to all API routes described in this documentation.

## Getting Started

To get started with the API, follow these steps:

1. **Make your first request**: Using a tool like `curl` or Postman, make your first API request to the `GET /data-element` endpoint to retrieve some sample data.
2. **Review individual endpoints**: Navigate through the sidebar to explore all the available endpoints, their parameters, and example responses.

## Request and Response Format

- **Request Format**: Most API endpoints accept data in `JSON` format, passed via the request body.
- **Response Format**: All responses will be in `JSON` format, typically consisting of data or error messages.

## Error Handling

We use standard HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of API requests:

- **200 OK**: The request was successful.
- **400 Bad Request**: The request was invalid or cannot be processed.
- **404 Not Found**: The requested resource could not be found.
- **500 Internal Server Error**: Something went wrong on our end.

Detailed error messages will be provided in the response body when errors occur, helping you understand the issue and how to resolve it.

## Rate Limiting

To ensure the stability of the service, our API employs rate limiting. The current rate limits are:

- **1000 requests per minute**: Exceeding this limit will result in a `429 Too Many Requests` response. Retry your request after some time.

## Support

If you encounter any issues while using the API, you can reach out to our support team via [dinkominfo@pekalongankab.go.id](mailto:dinkominfo@pekalongankab.go.id). We'll be happy to assist you.
